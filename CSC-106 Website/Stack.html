        <h2>About the Program</h2>
        <p>
            This is a stacking game where you player attempts to achieve the lowest score possible by aligning moving platforms on top of a stationary platform. The game consists of multiple platforms that move horizontally across the screen. The player must press the spacebar at the right time to stop the moving platform and align it with the previous platform. If successful, a new platform is generated. If the alignment is incorrect, then a new smaller platform is generated based on the failure to perfectly align. If aligned completely incorrectly then the player loses. The score is determined by the number of successfully stacked platforms and the time elapsed. The goal is to achieve the lowest score possible. Players can choose from different visual themes. Overall, it's a challenging and interactive stacking game with visual elements and scoring mechanics.
